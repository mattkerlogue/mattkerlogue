# :wave: Hi :wave:, I'm Matt, I do things with data

I’m a freelance data science, analysis and visualisation consultant based in London. I have a passion for data storytelling and making analytical insights accessible to all, particularly for the public good. I have subject specialism in public governance, organisational effectiveness, employee engagement, and software development for reproducible analysis. Prior to my freelance career I worked in a number of analytical roles at the [Cabinet Office (@co-analysis)](https://github.com/co-analysis/), as well as a stint at the [OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation](http://oecd-opsi.org).

I work largely in R, alongside HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I am also comfortable working with Python and SQL as well as having experience of a number of other programming languages and analytical software.

I also blog from time to time as [The Lapsed Geographer](http://lapsedgeographer.london/).
