# :wave: Hi :wave:, I'm Matt, I do things with data

I am a senior analyst and data scientist working in the public sector ([@co-analysis](https://github.com/co-analysis/)), my work is largely concentrated on helping other analysts make better use of new tools and techniques. I also occasionally write posts to my [personal blog](https://lapsedgeographer.london/) about coding (largely in R) and I sometimes occasionally [tweet](https://twitter.com/mattkerlogue).
