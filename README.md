# :wave: Hi :wave:, I'm Matt, I do things with data

I’m a freelance data science, analysis and visualisation consultant based in London. I have a passion for data storytelling and making analytical insights accessible to all, particularly for the public good. I have subject specialism in public governance, organisational effectiveness, employee engagement, and software development for reproducible analysis.

I work largely in R, alongside HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I am also comfortable working with Python and SQL as well as having experience of a number of other programming languages.

I’m on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/mattkerlogue) and <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@mattkerlogue">Mastodon</a>. I also blog from time to time as [The Lapsed Geographer](http://lapsedgeographer.london/).
