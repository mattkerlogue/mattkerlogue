# :wave: Hi :wave:, I'm Matt, I do things with data

I'm a data scientist/analyst/researcher with a passion for data storytelling and making analytical insights accessible to all, particularly for the public good. I currently work at the [Blavatnik School of Government, Unviersity of Oxford](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk).

I have subject specialism in public governance, organisational effectiveness, employee engagement, and software development for reproducible analysis. I've previously been a freelancer, and for many years worked in a number of analytical roles at the [Cabinet Office (@co-analysis)](https://github.com/co-analysis/), as well as a stint at the [OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation](http://oecd-opsi.org).

I work largely in R, alongside HTML/CSS and JavaScript, but I've also worked with Python and SQL as well as various other programming languages and analytical software. I have two general purpose R packages, [`{tidyods}`](https://github.com/mattkerlogue/tidyods) for working with ODS files and [`{shrthnd}`](https://github.com/mattkerlogue/shrthnd) for working with numeric data that also includes non-numeric symbols and shorthand.

Iâ€™m on <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@mattkerlogue">Mastodon</a> and I'm still [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/mattkerlogue). I also blog from time to time as [The Lapsed Geographer](http://lapsedgeographer.london/).
