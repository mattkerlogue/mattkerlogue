# :wave: Hi :wave:, I'm Matt, I do things with data

I'm a data scientist/analyst/researcher with a passion for data storytelling and making analytical insights accessible to all, particularly for the public good. I currently work at the Blavatnik School of Government, Unviersity of Oxford.

I have subject specialism in public governance, organisational effectiveness, employee engagement, and software development for reproducible analysis. I've previously been a freelancer, and for many years worked in a number of analytical roles at the [Cabinet Office (@co-analysis)](https://github.com/co-analysis/), as well as a stint at the [OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation](http://oecd-opsi.org).

I work largely in R, alongside HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I am also comfortable working with Python and SQL as well as having experience of a number of other programming languages and analytical software.

Read more about my skills, experience and work on my [portfolio website](https://matt.kerlogue.co.uk). Iâ€™m on <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@mattkerlogue">Mastodon</a> and still [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/mattkerlogue), though I don't post very often. I also blog from time to time as [The Lapsed Geographer](http://lapsedgeographer.london/).
